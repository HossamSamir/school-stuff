### What is a stack!?
#### a stack is a data structure used to store a collection of objects. Individual items can be added and stored in a stack using a ``push()`` method. Objects can be removed using a ``pop()`` method, which removes an item from the stack.

[source code (``push() - pop() - isEmpty() - isFull() - peek() - display()``)](Stack/Stack.cs)

### What is a Queue!?
#### Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.

[source code (``enqueue() - dequeue() - isEmpty() - isFull() - peek() - display()``)](Queue/Queue.cs)
