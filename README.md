### What is a stack!?
#### a stack is a data structure used to store a collection of objects. Individual items can be added and stored in a stack using a ``push()`` method. Objects can be removed using a ``pop()`` method, which removes an item from the stack.

[source code (``push() - pop() - isEmpty() - isFull() - peek() - display()``)](Stack/Stack.cs)
